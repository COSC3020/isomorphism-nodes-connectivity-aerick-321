# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

If two graphs have the same number of nodes then each node in graph A corresponds to a node in graph B, |V1| = |V2| = n, both sets had the same number of n (nodes). There is a mapping that assigns each vertex in V1​ to a unique vertex in V2 without leaving any unmatched so that means it is one to one. If they are completely connected then each node has the same number of edges and and is connected to every other node. That means since all of the nodes are connected there is no room for other combinations. So in graph A for each node and edge there is a node and edge that correspond in graph B making them bijective and isomorphic.
